**Example 1: The Hot Hand Fallacy**

* Test: Analyze the performance of a basketball team over a series of games. Calculate the probability of the team winning each game based on their previous performance. Compare the actual results to the predicted results to see if the team's performance is more likely to continue than it should be.

**Example 2: The Availability Heuristic**

* Test: Conduct a survey to ask people about their perceptions of the likelihood of different types of accidents (e.g. plane crashes, car accidents, etc.). Compare the perceived likelihood of each type of accident to the actual likelihood based on data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

**Example 3: The Regression Toward the Mean**

* Test: Analyze the performance of a group of students on a standardized test over a series of years. Calculate the average score of the group each year and compare it to the average score of the group the previous year. See if the average score tends to move towards the mean over time.

**Example 4: The Survivorship Bias**

* Test: Analyze the performance of a group of startups over a series of years. Calculate the survival rate of each startup and compare it to the survival rate of a random sample of startups. See if the startups that are still in business tend to have better performance than the startups that have failed.

**Example 5: The Base Rate Fallacy**

* Test: Conduct a survey to ask people about their perceptions of the likelihood of different medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, etc.). Compare the perceived likelihood of each condition to the actual likelihood based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Example 6: The Gambler's Fallacy**

* Test: Analyze the performance of a roulette wheel over a series of spins. Calculate the probability of the wheel landing on a particular number based on the previous spins. Compare the actual results to the predicted results to see if the wheel's performance is more likely to continue than it should be.

**Example 7: The Hindsight Bias**

* Test: Conduct a survey to ask people about their perceptions of the likelihood of different historical events (e.g. the rise of the Roman Empire, the fall of the Berlin Wall, etc.). Compare the perceived likelihood of each event to the actual likelihood based on historical data.

**Example 8: The Anchoring Effect**

* Test: Conduct a survey to ask people about their perceptions of the value of different products (e.g. cars, houses, etc.). Compare the perceived value of each product to the actual value based on market data. See if the perceived value is influenced by the initial price or value presented.

**Example 9: The Framing Effect**

* Test: Conduct a survey to ask people about their perceptions of the likelihood of different medical treatments (e.g. surgery, medication, etc.). Compare the perceived likelihood of each treatment to the actual likelihood based on data from the CDC. See if the framing of the treatment (e.g. "surgery has a 90% success rate" vs. "surgery has a 10% failure rate") influences people's perceptions.

**Example 10: The Sunk Cost Fallacy**

* Test: Analyze the performance of a group of investors over a series of years. Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each investor and compare it to the ROI of a random sample of investors. See if the investors who have invested more money tend to have better performance than the investors who have invested less money.

These are just a few examples of empirical tests that you can use to explore statistical effects. Remember to collect and analyze data carefully, and to consider the limitations of your study when interpreting your results.
